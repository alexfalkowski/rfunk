# RFUNK

As I have been using Ruby I have been really enjoying it. So much that I want to add some functional concepts.

## Maybe Monad

The concept of nil is all over Ruby. I want to explore how we would go about having optional types.

## Immutability

Most OO languages are encourage mutable state. I want to explore creating types that are immutable.
